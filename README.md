One such measure is the "Challenge Required" error message that users may encounter. This article delves into what this error means, why it occurs, and how users can resolve it.

# What Does "Challenge Required" Mean?
The "Challenge Required" error on Instagram is a security feature designed to verify the identity of users when the system detects unusual activity.
